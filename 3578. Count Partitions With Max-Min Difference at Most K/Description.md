# 3578. Count Partitions With Max-Min Difference at Most K

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to partition `nums` into one or more **non-empty** contiguous segments such that in each segment, the difference between its **maximum** and **minimum** elements is **at most** `k`.

Return the total number of ways to partition `nums` under this condition.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [9,4,1,3,7], k = 4

Output: 6

Explanation:

There are 6 valid partitions where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in each segment is at most k = 4:

 - [[9], [4], [1], [3], [7]]
 -  [[9], [4], [1], [3, 7]]
 -  [[9], [4], [1, 3], [7]]
 -  [[9], [4, 1], [3], [7]]
 -  [[9], [4, 1], [3, 7]]
 -  [[9], [4, 1, 3], [7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,3,4], k = 0

Output: 2

Explanation:

There are 2 valid partitions that satisfy the given conditions:

 - [[3], [3], [4]]
 -  [[3, 3], [4]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= k <= 10^9`

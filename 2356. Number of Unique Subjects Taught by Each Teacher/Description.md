# 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

SQL Schema:

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Teacher (teacher_id int, subject_id int, dept_id int)
Truncate table Teacher
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '2', '3')
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '2', '4')
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '3', '3')
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '1', '1')
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '2', '1')
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '3', '1')
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '4', '1')
```

Pandas Schema:

```python
data = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 3], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [2, 4, 1]]
Teacher = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['teacher_id', 'subject_id', 'dept_id']).astype({'teacher_id':'Int64', 'subject_id':'Int64', 'dept_id':'Int64'})
```

Table: `Teacher`

```()
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |
+-------------+------+
(subject_id, dept_id) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.
```

Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```()
Input: 
Teacher table:
+------------+------------+---------+
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |

| 2          | 4          | 1       |
+------------+------------+---------+
Output:  
+------------+-----+
| teacher_id | cnt |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |
+------------+-----+

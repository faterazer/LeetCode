# 399. Evaluate Division

You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where `equations[i] = [A_i, B_i]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `A_i / B_i = values[i]`. Each `A_i` or `B_i` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [C_j, D_j]` represents the `j-th` query where you must find the answer for `C_j / D_j = ?`.

Return *the answers to all queries*. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

**Example 1:**

```()
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
```

**Example 2:**

```()
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
```

**Example 3:**

```()
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= equations.length <= 20`
- `equations[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= A_i.length, B_i.length <= 5`
- `values.length == equations.length`
- `0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= C_j.length, D_j.length <= 5`
- `A_i, B_i, C_j, D_j` consist of lower case English letters and digits.

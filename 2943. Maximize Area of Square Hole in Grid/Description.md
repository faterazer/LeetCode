# 2943. Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid

You are given the two integers, `n` and `m` and two integer arrays, `hBars` and `vBars`. The grid has `n + 2` horizontal and `m + 2` vertical bars, creating 1 x 1 unit cells. The bars are indexed starting from `1`.

You can **remove** some of the bars in `hBars` from horizontal bars and some of the bars in `vBars` from vertical bars. Note that other bars are fixed and cannot be removed.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum area** of a *square-shaped* hole in the grid, after removing some bars (possibly none).

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/05/screenshot-from-2023-11-05-22-40-25.png)

```text
Input: n = 2, m = 1, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The left image shows the initial grid formed by the bars. The horizontal bars are [1,2,3,4], and the vertical bars are [1,2,3].

One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/04/screenshot-from-2023-11-04-17-01-02.png)

```text
Input: n = 1, m = 1, hBars = [2], vBars = [2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

To get the maximum square-shaped hole, we remove horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 2, m = 3, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2,4]

Output: 4

Explanation:

One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 3, and vertical bar 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= m <= 10^9`
- `1 <= hBars.length <= 100`
- `2 <= hBars[i] <= n + 1`
- `1 <= vBars.length <= 100`
- `2 <= vBars[i] <= m + 1`
- All values in `hBars` are distinct.
- All values in `vBars` are distinct.

# 1292. Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to Threshold

Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`, return *the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than or equal to* `threshold` *or return* `0` *if there is no such square*.

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/05/e1.png)

```text
Input: mat = [[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2]], threshold = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum side length of square with sum less than 4 is 2 as shown.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: mat = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2]], threshold = 1
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `0 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4`
- `0 <= threshold <= 10^5`

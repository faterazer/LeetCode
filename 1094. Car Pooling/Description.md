# 1094. Car Pooling

There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trips[i] = [numPassengers_i, from_i, to_i]` indicates that the `i-th` trip has `numPassengersi` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are `from_i` and `to_i` respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` *if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or* `false` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

```()
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```()
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= trips.length <= 1000`
- `trips[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= numPassengers_i <= 100`
- `0 <= from_i < to_`
- `i <= 1000`
- `1 <= capacity <= 105`

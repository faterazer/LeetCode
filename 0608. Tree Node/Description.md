# 608. Tree Node

SQL Schema:

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Tree (id int, p_id int)
Truncate table Tree
insert into Tree (id, p_id) values ('1', NULL)
insert into Tree (id, p_id) values ('2', '1')
insert into Tree (id, p_id) values ('3', '1')
insert into Tree (id, p_id) values ('4', '2')
insert into Tree (id, p_id) values ('5', '2')
```

Pandas Schema:

```()
data = [[1, None], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 2], [5, 2]]
tree = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['id', 'p_id']).astype({'id':'Int64', 'p_id':'Int64'})
```

Table: `Tree`

```()
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| p_id        | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.
```

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

- **"Leaf"**: if the node is a leaf node.
- **"Root"**: if the node is the root of the tree.
- **"Inner"**: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/22/tree1.jpg)

```()
Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: 
Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.
```

**Example 2:**

![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/22/tree2.jpg)

```()
Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.
```

# 270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a `target` value, return *the value in the BST that is closest to the* `target`. If there are multiple answers, print the smallest.

**Example 1:**

```()
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```()
Input: root = [1], target = 4.428571
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

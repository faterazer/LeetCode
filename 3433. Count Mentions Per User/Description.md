# 3433. Count Mentions Per User

You are given an integer `numberOfUsers` representing the total number of users and an array `events` of size `n x 3`.

Each `events[i]` can be either of the following two types:

1. **Message Event:** `["MESSAGE", "timestamp_i", "mentions_string_i"]`
   - This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at `timestamp_i`.
   - The `mentions_string_i` string can contain one of the following tokens:
     - `id<number>`: where `<number>` is an integer in range `[0,numberOfUsers - 1]`. There can be **multiple** ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
     - `ALL`: mentions **all** users.
     - `HERE`: mentions all **online** users.
2. **Offline Event:** `["OFFLINE", "timestamp_i", "id_i"]`
   - This event indicates that the user `id_i` had become offline at `timestamp_i` for **60 time units**. The user will automatically be online again at time `timestamp_i + 60`.

Return an array `mentions` where `mentions[i]` represents the number of mentions the user with id `i` has across all `MESSAGE` events.

All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed *before* handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.

**Note** that a user can be mentioned **multiple** times in a **single** message event, and each mention should be counted **separately**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","71","HERE"]]

Output: [2,2]

Explanation:

Initially, all users are online.

At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]

At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.

At timestamp 71, id0 comes back online and "HERE" is mentioned. mentions = [2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","12","ALL"]]

Output: [2,2]

Explanation:

Initially, all users are online.

At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]

At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.

At timestamp 12, "ALL" is mentioned. This includes offline users, so both id0 and id1 are mentioned. mentions = [2,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["OFFLINE","10","0"],["MESSAGE","12","HERE"]]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

Initially, all users are online.

At timestamp 10, id0 goes offline.

At timestamp 12, "HERE" is mentioned. Because id0 is still offline, they will not be mentioned. mentions = [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numberOfUsers <= 100`
- `1 <= events.length <= 100`
- `events[i].length == 3`
- `events[i][0]` will be one of `MESSAGE` or `OFFLINE`.
- `1 <= int(events[i][1]) <= 10^5`
- The number of `id<number>` mentions in any `"MESSAGE"` event is between `1` and `100`.
- `0 <= <number> <= numberOfUsers - 1`
- It is **guaranteed** that the user id referenced in the `OFFLINE` event is **online** at the time the event occurs.

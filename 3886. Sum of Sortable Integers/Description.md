# 3886. Sum of Sortable Integers

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

An integer `k` is called **sortable** if `k` **divides** `n` and you can sort `nums` in **non-decreasing** order by sequentially performing the following operations:

- Partition `nums` into **consecutive** [subarray](A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.) of length `k`.

- **Cyclically rotate each subarray independently** any number of times to the left or to the right.

Return an integer denoting the sum of all possible sortable integers `k`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:

- For n = 3, possible divisors are 1 and 3.
- For k = 1: each subarray has one element. No rotation can sort the array.
- For k = 3: the single subarray [3, 1, 2] can be rotated once to produce [1, 2, 3], which is sorted.
- Only k = 3 is sortable. Hence, the answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [7,6,5]

Output: 0

Explanation:

- For n = 3, possible divisors are 1 and 3.
- For k = 1: each subarray has one element. No rotation can sort the array.
- For k = 3: the single subarray [7, 6, 5] cannot be rotated into non-decreasing order.
- No k is sortable. Hence, the answer is 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [5,8]

Output: 3

Explanation:

- For n = 2, possible divisors are 1 and 2.
- Since [5, 8] is already sorted, every divisor is sortable. Hence, the answer is 1 + 2 = 3.
```

 **Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

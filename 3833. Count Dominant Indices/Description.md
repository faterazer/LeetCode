# 3833. Count Dominant Indices

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

An element at index `i` is called **dominant** if: `nums[i] > average(nums[i + 1], nums[i + 2], ..., nums[n - 1])`

Your task is to count the number of indices `i` that are **dominant**.

The **average** of a set of numbers is the value  obtained by adding all the numbers together and dividing the sum by the  total number of numbers.

**Note**: The **rightmost** element of any array is **not** **dominant**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [5,4,3]

Output: 2

Explanation:

- At index i = 0, the value 5 is dominant as 5 > average(4, 3) = 3.5.
- At index i = 1, the value 4 is dominant over the subarray [3].
- Index i = 2 is not dominant as there are no elements to its right. Thus, the answer is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [4,1,2]

Output: 1

Explanation:

- At index i = 0, the value 4 is dominant over the subarray [1, 2].
- At index i = 1, the value 1 is not dominant.
- Index i = 2 is not dominant as there are no elements to its right. Thus, the answer is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

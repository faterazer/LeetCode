# 2595. Number of Even and Odd Bits

You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` with value 1.

Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` with value 1.

Note that bits are indexed from **right to left** in the binary representation of a number.

Return the array `[even, odd]`.

**Example 1:**

```()
Input: n = 50

Output: [1,2]

Explanation:

The binary representation of 50 is 110010.

It contains 1 on indices 1, 4, and 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```()
Input: n = 2

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

The binary representation of 2 is 10.

It contains 1 only on index 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

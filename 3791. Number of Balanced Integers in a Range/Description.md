# 3791. Number of Balanced Integers in a Range

You are given two integers `low` and `high`.

An integer is called **balanced** if it satisfies **both** of the following conditions:

- It contains **at least** two digits.
- The **sum of digits at even positions** is equal to the **sum of digits at odd positions** (the leftmost digit has position 1).

Return an integer representing the number of balanced integers in the range `[low, high]` (both inclusive).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: low = 1, high = 100

Output: 9

Explanation:

The 9 balanced numbers between 1 and 100 are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: low = 120, high = 129

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only 121 is balanced because the sum of digits at even and odd positions are both 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: low = 1234, high = 1234

Output: 0

Explanation:

1234 is not balanced because the sum of digits at odd positions (1 + 3 = 4) does not equal the sum at even positions (2 + 4 = 6).
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= low <= high <= 10^15`

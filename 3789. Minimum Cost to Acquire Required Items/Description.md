# 3789. Minimum Cost to Acquire Required Items

You are given five integers `cost1`, `cost2`, `costBoth`, `need1`, and `need2`.

There are three types of items available:

- An item of **type 1** costs `cost1` and contributes 1 unit to the type 1 requirement only.
- An item of **type 2** costs `cost2` and contributes 1 unit to the type 2 requirement only.
- An item of **type 3** costs `costBoth` and contributes 1 unit to **both** type 1 and type 2 requirements.

You must collect enough items so that the total contribution toward type 1 is **at least** `need1` and the total contribution toward type 2 is **at least** `need2`.

Return an integer representing the **minimum** possible total cost to achieve these requirements.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: cost1 = 3, cost2 = 2, costBoth = 1, need1 = 3, need2 = 2

Output: 3

Explanation:

After buying three type 3 items, which cost 3 * 1 = 3, the total contribution to type 1 is 3 (>= need1 = 3) and to type 2 is 3 (>= need2 = 2).
Any other valid combination would cost more, so the minimum total cost is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: cost1 = 5, cost2 = 4, costBoth = 15, need1 = 2, need2 = 3

Output: 22

Explanation:

We buy need1 = 2 items of type 1 and need2 = 3 items of type 2: 2 * 5 + 3 * 4 = 10 + 12 = 22.
Any other valid combination would cost more, so the minimum total cost is 22.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: cost1 = 5, cost2 = 4, costBoth = 15, need1 = 0, need2 = 0

Output: 0

Explanation:

Since no items are required (need1 = need2 = 0), we buy nothing and pay 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cost1, cost2, costBoth <= 10^6`
- `0 <= need1, need2 <= 10^9`

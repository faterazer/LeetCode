# 882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph

You are given an undirected graph (the **"original graph"**) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You decide to **subdivide** each edge in the graph into a chain of nodes, with the number of new nodes varying between each edge.

The graph is given as a 2D array of `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, cnt_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` in the original graph, and `cnt_i` is the total number of new nodes that you will **subdivide** the edge into. Note that `cnt_i == 0` means you will not subdivide the edge.

To **subdivide** the edge `[u_i, v_i]`, replace it with `(cnt_i + 1)` new edges and `cnt_i` new nodes. The new nodes are `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_cnti`, and the new edges are `[u_i, x_1]`, `[x_1, x_2]`, `[x_2, x_3]`, ..., `[x_cnti-1, x_cnti]`, `[x_cnti, v_i]`.

In this **new graph**, you want to know how many nodes are **reachable** from the node `0`, where a node is **reachable** if the distance is `maxMoves` or less.

Given the original graph and `maxMoves`, return *the number of nodes that are **reachable** from node* `0` *in the new graph*.

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/08/01/origfinal.png)

```()
Input: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], maxMoves = 6, n = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: The edge subdivisions are shown in the image above.
The nodes that are reachable are highlighted in yellow.
```

**Example 2:**

```()
Input: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], maxMoves = 10, n = 4
Output: 23
```

**Example 3:**

```()
Input: edges = [[1,2,4],[1,4,5],[1,3,1],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]], maxMoves = 17, n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Node 0 is disconnected from the rest of the graph, so only node 0 is reachable.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 10^4)`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= u_i < v_i < n`
- There are **no multiple edges** in the graph.
- `0 <= cnt_i <= 10^4`
- `0 <= maxMoves <= 10^9`
- `1 <= n <= 3000`

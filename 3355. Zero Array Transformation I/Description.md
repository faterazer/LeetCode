# 3355. Zero Array Transformation I

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [li, ri]`.

For each `queries[i]`:

- Select a [subset](A **subset** of an array is a selection of elements (possibly none) of the array.) of indices within the range `[li, ri]` in `nums`.
- Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.

A **Zero Array** is an array where all elements are equal to 0.

Return `true` if it is *possible* to transform `nums` into a **Zero Array** after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```()
Input: nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]

Output: true

Explanation:

- For i = 0:
    - Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
    - The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.
```

**Example 2:**

```()
Input: nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2]]

Output: false

Explanation:

- For i = 0:
    - Select the subset of indices as [1, 2, 3] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
    - The array will become [4, 2, 1, 0].
- For i = 1:
    - Select the subset of indices as [0, 1, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
    - The array will become [3, 1, 0, 0], which is not a Zero Array.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= l_i <= r_i < nums.length`

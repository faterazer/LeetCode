# 3769. Sort Integers by Binary Reflection

You are given an integer array `nums`.

The **binary reflection** of a **positive** integer is defined as the number obtained by reversing the order of its **binary** digits (ignoring any leading zeros) and interpreting the resulting binary number as a decimal.

Sort the array in **ascending** order based on the binary reflection of each element. If two different numbers have the same binary reflection, the **smaller** original number should appear first.

Return the resulting sorted array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [4,5,4]

Output: [4,4,5]

Explanation:

Binary reflections are:

 -  4 -> (binary) 100 -> (reversed) 001 -> 1
 -  5 -> (binary) 101 -> (reversed) 101 -> 5
 -  4 -> (binary) 100 -> (reversed) 001 -> 1

Sorting by the reflected values gives [4, 4, 5].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,6,5,8]

Output: [8,3,6,5]

Explanation:

Binary reflections are:

-  3 -> (binary) 11 -> (reversed) 11 -> 3
 -  6 -> (binary) 110 -> (reversed) 011 -> 3
 -  5 -> (binary) 101 -> (reversed) 101 -> 5
 -  8 -> (binary) 1000 -> (reversed) 0001 -> 1

Sorting by the reflected values gives [8, 3, 6, 5].
Note that 3 and 6 have the same reflection, so we arrange them in increasing order of original value.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

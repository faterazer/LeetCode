# 3772. Maximum Subgraph Score in a Tree

You are given an **undirected tree** with `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.

You are also given an integer array `good` of length `n`, where `good[i]` is 1 if the `i-th` node is good, and 0 if it is bad.

Define the **score** of a **subgraph** as the number of good nodes minus the number of bad nodes in that subgraph.

For each node `i`, find the **maximum** possible score among all **connected subgraphs** that contain node `i`.

Return an array of `n` integers where the `i-th` element is the **maximum** score for node `i`.

A **subgraph** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph.

A **connected subgraph** is a subgraph in which every pair of its vertices is reachable from one another using only its edges.

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/11/17/tree1fixed.png)

```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], good = [1,0,1]

Output: [1,1,1]

Explanation:

 -  Green nodes are good and red nodes are bad.
 -  For each node, the best connected subgraph containing it is the whole tree, which has 2 good nodes and 1 bad node, resulting in a score of 1.
 -  Other connected subgraphs containing a node may have the same score.
```

**Example 2:**

![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/11/17/tree2.png)

```text
Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], good = [0,1,0,1,1]

Output: [2,3,2,3,3]

Explanation:

 -  Node 0: The best connected subgraph consists of nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, which has 3 good nodes and 1 bad node, resulting in a score of 3 - 1 = 2.
 -  Nodes 1, 3, and 4: The best connected subgraph consists of nodes 1, 3, 4, which has 3 good nodes, resulting in a score of 3.
 -  Node 2: The best connected subgraph consists of nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, which has 3 good nodes and 1 bad node, resulting in a score of 3 - 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

![example 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/11/17/tree3.png)

```text
Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], good = [0,0]

Output: [-1,-1]

Explanation:

For each node, including the other node only adds another bad node, so the best score for both nodes is -1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
- `good.length == n`
- `0 <= good[i] <= 1`
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

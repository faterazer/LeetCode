# 3803. Count Residue Prefixes

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters.

A **prefix** of `s` is called a **residue** if the number of **distinct characters** in the **prefix** is equal to `len(prefix) % 3`.

Return the count of **residue** prefixes in `s`.

A **prefix** of a string is a **non-empty substring** that starts from the beginning of the string and extends to any point within it.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "abc"

Output: 2

Explanation:
- Prefix "a" has 1 distinct character and length modulo 3 is 1, so it is a residue.
- Prefix "ab" has 2 distinct characters and length modulo 3 is 2, so it is a residue.
- Prefix "abc" does not satisfy the condition. Thus, the answer is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "dd"

Output: 1

Explanation:
- Prefix "d" has 1 distinct character and length modulo 3 is 1, so it is a residue.
- Prefix "dd" has 1 distinct character but length modulo 3 is 2, so it is not a residue. Thus, the answer is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```text

Input: s = "bob"

Output: 2

Explanation:
- Prefix "b" has 1 distinct character and length modulo 3 is 1, so it is a residue.
- Prefix "bo" has 2 distinct characters and length mod 3 is 2, so it is a residue. Thus, the answer is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

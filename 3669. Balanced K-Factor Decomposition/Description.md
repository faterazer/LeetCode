# 3669. Balanced K-Factor Decomposition

Given two integers `n` and `k`, split the number `n` into exactly `k` positive integers such that the **product** of these integers is equal to `n`.

Return *any* *one* split in which the **maximum** difference between any two numbers is **minimized**. You may return the result in *any order*.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 100, k = 2

Output: [10,10]

Explanation:

The split [10, 10] yields 10 * 10 = 100 and a max-min difference of 0, which is minimal.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 44, k = 3

Output: [2,2,11]

Explanation:

- Split [1, 1, 44] yields a difference of 43
- Split [1, 2, 22] yields a difference of 21
- Split [1, 4, 11] yields a difference of 10
- Split [2, 2, 11] yields a difference of 9

Therefore, [2, 2, 11] is the optimal split with the smallest difference 9.
```

**Constraints:**

- `4 <= n <= 10^5`
- `2 <= k <= 5`
- `k` is strictly less than the total number of positive divisors of `n`.

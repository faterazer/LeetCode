# 2944. Minimum Number of Coins for Fruits

You are given an **1-indexed** integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` denotes the number of coins needed to purchase the `i-th` fruit.

The fruit market has the following reward for each fruit:

- If you purchase the `i-th` fruit at `prices[i]` coins, you can get any number of the next `i` fruits for free.

**Note** that even if you **can** take fruit `j` for free, you can still purchase it for `prices[j]` coins to receive its reward.

Return the **minimum** number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.

**Example 1:**

```()
Input: prices = [3,1,2]

Output: 4

Explanation:
- Purchase the 1st fruit with prices[0] = 3 coins, you are allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free.
- Purchase the 2nd fruit with prices[1] = 1 coin, you are allowed to take the 3rd fruit for free.
- Take the 3rd fruit for free.
Note that even though you could take the 2nd fruit for free as a reward of buying 1st fruit, you purchase it to receive its reward, which is more optimal.
```

**Example 2:**

```()
Input: prices = [1,10,1,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:
- Purchase the 1st fruit with prices[0] = 1 coin, you are allowed to take the 2nd fruit for free.
- Take the 2nd fruit for free.
- Purchase the 3rd fruit for prices[2] = 1 coin, you are allowed to take the 4th fruit for free.
- Take the 4th fruit for free.
```

**Example 3:**

```()
Input: prices = [26,18,6,12,49,7,45,45]

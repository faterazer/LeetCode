# 3805. Count Caesar Cipher Pairs

You are given an array `words` of `n` strings. Each string has length `m` and contains only lowercase English letters.

Two strings `s` and `t` are **similar** if we can apply the following operation any number of times (possibly zero times) so that `s` and `t` become **equal**.

- Choose either `s` or `t`.
- Replace **every** letter in the chosen string with the next letter in the alphabet cyclically. The next letter after `'z'` is `'a'`.

Count the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:

- `i < j`
- `words[i]` and `words[j]` are **similar**.

Return an integer denoting the number of such pairs.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: words = ["fusion","layout"]

Output: 1

Explanation:

words[0] = "fusion" and words[1] = "layout" are similar because we can apply the operation to "fusion" 6 times. The string "fusion" changes as follows.

    "fusion"
    "gvtjpo"
    "hwukqp"
    "ixvlrq"
    "jywmsr"
    "kzxnts"
    "layout"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: words = ["ab","aa","za","aa"]

Output: 2

Explanation:

words[0] = "ab" and words[2] = "za" are similar. words[1] = "aa" and words[3] = "aa" are similar.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == words.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= m == words[i].length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= n * m <= 10^5`
- `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

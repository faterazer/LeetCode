# 3661. Maximum Walls Destroyed by Robots

There is an endless straight line populated with some robots and walls. You are given integer arrays `robots`, `distance`, and `walls`:

- `robots[i]` is the position of the `ith` robot.
- `distance[i]` is the **maximum** distance the `ith` robot's bullet can travel.
- `walls[j]` is the position of the `jth` wall.

Every robot has **one** bullet that can either fire to the left or the right **at most** `distance[i]` meters.

A bullet destroys every wall in its path that lies within its range.  Robots are fixed obstacles: if a bullet hits another robot before  reaching a wall, it **immediately stops** at that robot and cannot continue.

Return the **maximum** number of **unique** walls that can be destroyed by the robots.

Notes:

- A wall and a robot may share the same position; the wall can be destroyed by the robot at that position.
- Robots are not destroyed by bullets.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: robots = [4], distance = [3], walls = [1,10]

Output: 1

Explanation:

- robots[0] = 4 fires left with distance[0] = 3, covering [1, 4] and destroys walls[0] = 1.
- Thus, the answer is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: robots = [10,2], distance = [5,1], walls = [5,2,7]

Output: 3

Explanation:

- robots[0] = 10 fires left with distance[0] = 5, covering [5, 10] and destroys walls[0] = 5 and walls[2] = 7.
- robots[1] = 2 fires left with distance[1] = 1, covering [1, 2] and destroys walls[1] = 2.
- Thus, the answer is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: robots = [1,2], distance = [100,1], walls = [10]

Output: 0

Explanation:

In this example, only robots[0] can reach the wall, but its shot to the right is blocked by robots[1]; thus the answer is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= robots.length == distance.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= walls.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= robots[i], walls[j] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= distance[i] <= 10^5`
- All values in `robots` are **unique**
- All values in `walls` are **unique**

# 3783. Mirror Distance of an Integer

You are given an integer `n`.

Define its **mirror distance** as: `abs(n - reverse(n))` where `reverse(n)` is the integer formed by reversing the digits of `n`.

Return an integer denoting the mirror distance of `n`.

`abs(x)` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 25

Output: 27

Explanation:

- reverse(25) = 52.
- Thus, the answer is abs(25 - 52) = 27.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 10

Output: 9

Explanation:

- reverse(10) = 01 which is 1.
- Thus, the answer is abs(10 - 1) = 9.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 7

Output: 0

Explanation:

- reverse(7) = 7.
- Thus, the answer is abs(7 - 7) = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`

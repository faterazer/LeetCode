# 3771. Total Score of Dungeon Runs

You are given a **positive** integer `hp` and two **positive** **1-indexed** integer arrays `damage` and `requirement`.

There is a dungeon with `n` trap rooms numbered from 1 to `n`. Entering room `i` reduces your health points by `damage[i]`. After that reduction, if your remaining health points are **at least** `requirement[i]`, you earn **1 point** for that room.

Let `score(j)` be the number of **points** you get if you start with `hp` health points and enter the rooms `j`, `j + 1`, ..., `n` in this order.

Return the integer `score(1) + score(2) + ... + score(n)`, the sum of scores over all starting rooms.

**Note**: You cannot skip rooms. You can finish your journey even if your health points become non-positive.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: hp = 11, damage = [3,6,7], requirement = [4,2,5]

Output: 3

Explanation:

score(1) = 2, score(2) = 1, score(3) = 0. The total score is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.

As an example, score(1) = 2 because you get 2 points if you start from room 1.

- You start with 11 health points.
- Enter room 1. Your health points are now 11 - 3 = 8. You get 1 point because 8 >= 4.
- Enter room 2. Your health points are now 8 - 6 = 2. You get 1 point because 2 >= 2.
- Enter room 3. Your health points are now 2 - 7 = -5. You do not get any points because -5 < 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: hp = 2, damage = [10000,1], requirement = [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation:

score(1) = 0, score(2) = 1. The total score is 0 + 1 = 1.

score(1) = 0 because you do not get any points if you start from room 1.

- You start with 2 health points.
- Enter room 1. Your health points are now 2 - 10000 = -9998. You do not get any points because -9998 < 1.
- Enter room 2. Your health points are now -9998 - 1 = -9999. You do not get any points because -9999 < 1.

score(2) = 1 because you get 1 point if you start from room 2.

- You start with 2 health points.
- Enter room 2. Your health points are now 2 - 1 = 1. You get 1 point because 1 >= 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= hp <= 10^9`
- `1 <= n == damage.length == requirement.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= damage[i], requirement[i] <= 10^4`

# 3898. Find the Degree of Each Vertex

You are given a 2D integer array `matrix` of size `n x n` representing the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph with `n` vertices labeled from 0 to `n - 1`.

- `matrix[i][j] = 1` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `i` and `j`.
- `matrix[i][j] = 0` indicates that there is no edge between vertices `i` and `j`.

The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.

Return an integer array `ans` of size `n` where `ans[i]` represents the degree of vertex `i`.

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2026/03/14/g41f.png)

```text
Input: matrix = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]]

Output: [2,2,2]

Explanation:

    Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 2, so its degree is 2.
    Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0 and 2, so its degree is 2.
    Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 0 and 1, so its degree is 2.

Thus, the answer is [2, 2, 2].
```

**Example 2:**

![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2026/03/14/g42f.png)

```text
Input: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]

Output: [1,1,0]

Explanation:

    Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 1, so its degree is 1.
    Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 0, so its degree is 1.
    Vertex 2 is not connected to any vertex, so its degree is 0.

Thus, the answer is [1, 1, 0].
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: matrix = [[0]]

Output: [0]

Explanation:

There is only one vertex and it has no edges connected to it. Thus, the answer is [0].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length <= 100`
- `matrix[i][i] == 0`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either 0 or 1
- `matrix[i][j] == matrix[j][i]`

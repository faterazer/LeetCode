# 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph

There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `u_i` and vertex `v_i`. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex `source` to vertex `destination`.

Given `edges` and the integers `n`, `source`, and `destination`, return `true` *if there is a **valid path** from* `source` *to* `destination`*, or* `false` *otherwise.*

**Example 1:**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex1.png)

```()
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: true
Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
- 0 → 1 → 2
- 0 → 2
```

**Example 2:**

![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex2.png)

```()
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
- `u_i != v_i`
- `0 <= source, destination <= n - 1`
- There are no duplicate edges.
- There are no self edges.
